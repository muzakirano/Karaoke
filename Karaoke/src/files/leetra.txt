Put your flags up in the sky
(Put them in the sky) (jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side
(Side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from
(Show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
When the moment gets tough
You've got keep going
One love, one life, one world
One fight, whole world, one night, one place
Brazil, everybody put your flags
In the sky and do what you feel
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
It's your world, my world, our world today
And we invite the whole world, whole world to play
Es mi mundo, tu mundo, el mundo de nosotros
Invitamos a todo el mundo a jugar con nosotros
Put your flags up in the sky

And wave them side to side

One night watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Full heart's gonna work so hard
Shoot, fall, the stars
Fists raised up towards the sky
Tonight watch the world unite
World unite, world unite
For the fight, fight, fight, one night
Watch the world unite
Two sides, one fight and a million eyes
Hey, hey, hey, força força come and sing with me
Hey, hey, hey, ole ole come shout it out with me
Hey, hey, hey, come on now

Claudia Leitte, obrigado
É meu, é seu
Hoje é tudo nosso
Quando eu chamo o mundo inteiro pra jogar
É pra mostrar que eu posso
Torcer, chorar, sorrir, gritar
Não importar o resultado, vamos extravasar
Put your flags up in the sky
(Put them in the sky) (jogue lá no alto)
And wave them side to side
(Side to side) (lado a lado)
Show the world where you're from
(Show them where you're from) (we are one, baby)
Show the world we are one (one love, life)
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
Ole, ole, ole, ola
